            Volker started his accounting career with Deloitte & Touche LLP in 1995, and obtained his CPA License in 1997. Volker has also been an avid pilot, obtaining his professional aviation ratings in 1989, and flying in various capacities since that time. Following his passion for aviation, he made a career change in 2004 when he accepted employment as an Airline Transport Pilot for a US based regional airline. Since that time he has continued to develop his accounting expertise with a focus on serving his fellow flight crew members with their personal and small business income tax preparation needs. Through high quality personalized service and word of mouth referrals, his client base has grown to include both pilots and flight attendants from almost every air carrier in the United States.
